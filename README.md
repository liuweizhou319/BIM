# Consistent Point Orientation for Manifold Surfaces via Boundary Integration

This is the reference implementation for the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference paper: "Consistent Point Orientation for Manifold Surfaces via Boundary Integration."

The code depends on the following third-party libraries: Eigen, CGAL, BOOST, LIBIGL, LBFGS++, geometry-central, and polyscope. 
We have already included LIBIGL, LBFGS++, geometry-central, and polyscope in the code.
